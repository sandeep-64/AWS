### Q: What is an Amazon S3 bucket?
A: The Amazon S3 bucket is a fundamental Storage Container feature in the AWS S3 Service. It provides a secure and scalable repository for storing Objects such as Text data, Images, Audio, and Video files over the AWS Cloud. Each S3 bucket name should be globally unique and configured with an ACL (Access Control List).

### Q: How Does Amazon S3 work?
A: Amazon S3 works on organizing the data into unique S3 Buckets, customizing the buckets with Access controls. It allows the users to store objects inside the S3 buckets by facilitating features like versioning and lifecycle management of data storage with scaling. The following are a few main features of Amazon s3:

#### Amazon S3 Buckets and Objects

Amazon S3 Bucket: Data in S3 is stored in containers called buckets. Each bucket has its own set of policies and configurations, enabling users to have more control over their data. Bucket Names must be unique. A bucket can be thought of as a parent folder of data. There is a limit of 100 buckets per AWS account, but AWS support can request an increase.

Amazon S3 Objects: Fundamental entity type stored in AWS S3.You can store as many objects as you want to store. The maximum size of an AWS S3 bucket is 5TB. It consists of the following:

   Key
   Version ID
   Value
   Metadata
   Subresources
   Access control information
   Tags

#### Amazon S3 Versioning and Access Control
   
S3 Versioning: Versioning means always keeping a record of previously uploaded files in S3. Points to Versioning are not enabled by default. Once enabled, it is enabled for all objects in a bucket. Versioning keeps all the copies of your file, so, it adds cost for storing multiple copies of your data. For example, 10 copies of a file of size 1GB will have you charged for using 10GBs for S3 space. Versioning is helpful to prevent unintended overwrites and deletions. Objects with the same key can be stored in a bucket if versioning is enabled (since they have a unique version ID). To know more about versioning refer this article – Amazon S3 Versioning

Access control lists (ACLs): A document for verifying access to S3 buckets from outside your AWS account. An ACL is specific to each bucket. You can utilize S3 Object Ownership, an Amazon S3 bucket-level feature, to manage who owns the objects you upload to your bucket and to enable or disable ACLs.

#### Bucket policies and Life Cycles

Bucket Policies: A document for verifying the access to S3 buckets from within your AWS account, controls which services and users have what kind of access to your S3 bucket. Each bucket has its own Bucket Policies.

Lifecycle Rules: This is a cost-saving practice that can move your files to AWS Glacier (The AWS Data Archive Service) or to some other S3 storage class for cheaper storage of old data or completely delete the data after the specified time. To know more about refer this article – Amazon S3 Life Cycle Management

#### Keys and Null Objects

Keys: The key, in S3, is a unique identifier for an object in a bucket. For example in a bucket ‘ABC’ your GFG.java file is stored at javaPrograms/GFG.java then ‘javaPrograms/GFG.java’ is your object key for GFG.java.

Null Object: Version ID for objects in a bucket where versioning is suspended is null. Such objects may be referred to as null objects.List) and Other settings for managing data efficiently.

### Q: How To Use an Amazon S3 Bucket?
A: You can use the Amazon S3 buckets by following the simple steps which are mentioned below. To know more how to configure about Amazon S3 refer to the Amazon S3 – Creating a S3 Bucket.

Step 1: Login into the Amazon account with your credentials and search form S3 and click on the S3. Now click on the option which is “Create bucket” and configure all the options which are shown while configuring.

Step 2: After configuring the AWS bucket now upload the objects into the buckets based upon your requirement. By using the AWS console or by using AWS CLI following is the command to upload the object into the AWS S3 bucket.

```
aws s3 cp <local-file-path> s3://<bucket-name>/
```

Step 3: You can control the permissions of the objects which was uploaded into the S3 buckets and also who can access the bucket. You can make the bucket public or private by default the S3 buckets will be in private mode.

Step 4: You can manage the S3 bucket lifecycle management by transitioning. Based upon the rules that you defined S3 bucket will be transitioning into different storage classes based on the age of the object which is uploaded into the S3 bucket.

Step 5: You need to turn to enable the services to monitor and analyze S3. You need to enable the S3 access logging to record who was requesting the objects which are in the S3 buckets.

### Q: What are the types of S3 Storage Classes?
A: Amazon S3 offers these storage classes:
- S3 Standard: Frequent access, highest availability
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering: Automatic cost optimization
- S3 Standard-IA: Infrequent access, lower cost
- S3 One Zone-IA: Single AZ storage, lowest IA cost
- S3 Glacier: Long-term archival
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest cost, longest retrieval
- S3 Outposts: On-premises S3 storage

### Q: How to Upload and Manage Files on Amazon S3?
A: Once the S3 Bucket is created, you can upload the files through various ways such as AWS SDKs, AWS CLI, and Amazon S3 Management Console. Try managing the files by organizing them into folders within the S3 Bucket and applying access controls to secure the access. Features like Versioning and Lifecycle policies provide the management of data efficiently with optimization of storage classes.

### Q: How to Access Amazon S3 Bucket?
A: We can work and access the Amazon S3 bucket by using any one of the following methods

- AWS Management Console
- AWS CLI Commands
- Programming Scripts ( Using boto3 library of Python )

### Q: What are AWS S3 Bucket Permissions?
A: You can manage the permission of S3 buckets by using several methods following are a few of them.

- Bucket Policies: Bucket policies can be attached directly to the S3 bucket and they are in JSON format which can perform the bucket level operations. With the help of bucket policies, you can grant permissions to the users who can access the objects present in the bucket. If you grant permissions to any user he can download, and upload the objects to the bucket. You can create the bucket policy by using Python.
- Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs are legacy access control mechanisms for S3 buckets instead of ACLs we are using the bucket policies to control the permissions of the S3 bucket. By using ACL you can grant the read, and access to the S3 bucket or you can make the objects public based on the requirements.
- IAM Policies: IAM policies are mostly used to manage the permissions to the users and groups and resources available in the AWS by using the IAM roles options. You can attach an IAM policy to an IAM entity (user, group, or role) granting them access to specific S3 buckets and operations.

### Q: What are the Features of Amazon S3?
A: 
- Durability: AWS claims Amazon S3 to have a 99.999999999% of durability (11 9’s). This means the possibility of losing your data stored on S3 is one in a billion.
- Availability: AWS ensures that the up-time of AWS S3 is 99.99% for standard access.
Note that availability is related to being able to access data and durability is related to losing data altogether.
Server-Side-Encryption (SSE): AWS S3 supports three types of SSE models:
- SSE-S3: AWS S3 manages encryption keys.
- SSE-C: The customer manages encryption keys.
- SSE-KMS: The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) manages the encryption keys.
- File Size support: AWS S3 can hold files of size ranging from 0 bytes to 5 terabytes. A 5TB limit on file size should not be a blocker for most of the applications in the world.
- Infinite storage space: Theoretically AWS S3 is supposed to have infinite storage space. This makes S3 infinitely scalable for all kinds of use cases.
- Pay as you use: The users are charged according to the S3 storage they hold.

### Q: What are the Advantages of Amazon S3?
A: Major advantages include:
- Scalability: Amazon S3 can be scalable horizontally which makes it handle a large amount of data. It can be scaled automatically without human intervention.
- High availability: AmazonS3 bucket is famous for its high availability nature you can access the data whenever you required it from any region. It offers a Service Level Agreement (SLA) guaranteeing 99.9% uptime.
- Data Lifecycle Management: You can manage the data which is stored in the S3 bucket by automating the transition and expiration of objects based on predefined rules. You can automatically move the data to the Standard-IA or Glacier, after a specified period.
- Integration with Other AWS Services: You can integrate the S3 bucket service with different services in the AWS like you can integrate with the AWS lambda function where the lambda will be triggered based upon the files or objects added to the S3 bucket.
