Q: What is Amazon EC2?
A: Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a core AWS service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It's essentially a virtual computing environment that allows you to:
- Launch virtual servers (instances) on-demand
- Configure security and networking
- Manage storage
- Scale capacity up or down based on computing requirements
- Pay only for the resources you actually use
- Choose from various operating systems and software configurations
- Deploy applications across multiple geographical locations

*Real-world examples:*
1. Netflix uses EC2 to stream videos to millions of users worldwide
2. Small Business Website:
   ```
   Configuration Example:
   - t3.micro instance running WordPress
   - EBS volume: 20GB for storage
   - Elastic IP for static address
   ```
3. Development Team Setup:
