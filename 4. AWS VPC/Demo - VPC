Demo-1: creating and configuring a VPC with security settings in AWS:

 1. VPC Creation and Setup
 Initial Configuration
- Navigate to VPC dashboard in AWS Console
- Select "VPC and more" for automated resource creation
- Configure basic settings:
  - Name: demo VPC
  - CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16 (65,536 IPs)
  - Availability Zone: eu-north-1a
  - Enable public subnets
  - Enable VPC endpoints for S3 Gateway

 Automatic Resource Creation
AWS automatically creates:
- Subnets
- Route tables
- Internet gateway

 2. EC2 Instance Deployment
 Instance Configuration
- Launch new EC2 instance
- Basic settings:
  - Name: demo-instance
  - AMI: Ubuntu
  - Instance type: t2.micro

 Network Settings
- Click "Edit" in network settings
- Select:
  - VPC: Choose demo VPC (not default)
  - Subnet: Select public subnet
  - Auto-assign public IP: Enable
  - Security group: Create new

 3. Application Deployment
 SSH Access
```
ssh -i aws_login.pem ubuntu@[public-ip]
```

 Server Setup
```
# Update system packages
sudo apt update

# Start Python HTTP server
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

 4. Security Group Configuration
 Initial Settings
- Default configuration:
  - Allows port 22 (SSH) only

 Adding HTTP Server Access
- Add inbound rule:
  - Type: Custom TCP
  - Port: 8000
  - Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (Anywhere-IPv4)

 5. NACL Configuration
 Default NACL Settings
- Location: VPC â†’ Network ACLs
- Default rules:
  - Rule 100: Allow all traffic (0.0.0.0/0)
  - Rule *: Implicit deny (automatic)

 Custom NACL Configuration
To block port 8000:
```
Rule 90:
- Action: DENY
- Port: 8000
- Source: 0.0.0.0/0

Rule 100:
- Action: ALLOW
- Traffic: All
- Source: 0.0.0.0/0
```

 NACL Rule Guidelines
- Rules processed in numerical order (lowest to highest)
- First matching rule applies
- DENY rules should have lower numbers than ALLOW rules
- Implicit deny exists at end of rules

 6. Testing and Verification
 Access Testing
1. Test application access:
   ```
   http://[public-ip]:8000
   ```

 Security Configuration Tests
1. Default security group (Expected: Blocked)
2. After adding port 8000 to security group (Expected: Allowed)
3. After adding NACL deny rule (Expected: Blocked)
4. Verify rule priority effects
