2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
   - AWS manages the underlying infrastructure
   - Benefits:
     - Developers can be more efficient
     - No need to worry about capacity planning
     - Eliminates software maintenance overhead
     - Handles resource procurement automatically
     - Manages patching
   - Allows focus on:
     - Application deployment
     - Application management
   - Examples:
     - Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
     - Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce)
     - Amazon ElasticSearch

3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
   - Complete product running on browser
   - Characteristics:
     - Fully managed by service provider
     - End-user only needs to focus on software usage
     - No infrastructure management required
     - Usually accessed through web browsers
